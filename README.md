# student-roster
C876 Performance Assessment C++ Application, came back a 100% pass.

This takes in predefined data in a comma-separated value format that is always consistent.

It turns them into working arrays of student data.

Then, it prints out the data, and prints data after performing manipulations on the data, such as removing an entire student.

In one case, it is meant to call on data that was deleted, and shows the error message printed out to handle the error.

Being able to handle different inputs would be a solid improvement, along with letting the user decide what to print out from the data during program exectution.
